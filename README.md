# Traffic-Sign-Image-Classification

Project Title:
Traffic sign type detection and recognition from image.

Project Description:
In this project we propose to classify the traffic signs from images. Traffic sign detection and classification in outdoor environment has received significant attention due to its relevance for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Traffic sign recognition is a challenging example, in which the algorithms have to cope with natural and thus complex dynamic environments and high accuracy demands.

Proposed Methodology:
The key to recognize the traffic signs is how to detect them and identify their geometric shapes.
We plan try various classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks to see the effectiveness of each of these methods.
Our focus will be on identifying some of the common data signs in the data set like pedestrian crossing, stop, signal ahead, added lane, keep right, merge, speed limit 25, and speed limit 35 signs. 
We will have to deal with the following scenarios in the analysis:

•	Different shapes

•	Different signs

•	Different positions

•	Rotation

•	Occlusion

•	Sign sizes



Machine Learning Models

•	MLP Classifier - in Essence , a CNN.

•	LinearSVC - SVM performs well with Image classification.

•	Random Forests - Quick to build and Classify.

•	Keras CNN - The Deep Learner Model.
